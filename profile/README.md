# Vision

We explore where the boundaries of automated software engineering lie with current LLMs.
We explore how the future software development process will evolve.


# Roadmap

### Concave Workspace:

The first IDE/Workspace designed for LLM agents, not for humans.

- Concave Hybrid Code Search
- Concave Sandbox
- Concave Playbook




### Concave Fleet:

A demonstrative framework for automatic GitHub issue resolution. 

Using concave hybrid code search and sandbox, in just one week, we significantly improved the problem localization success rate on the SWE-Bench Verify test set.
